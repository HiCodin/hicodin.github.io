title: Starting out again
---

For the past couple months, I've been attending some class to reignite my flame in programming field. So far I am still learning at a slow pace and that is something that I need to work on.

On a side note, ```VSCODE``` is a really nice tool. Don't get me wrong. I still love vim and use vim in everyday of my life but when I'm doing ```nodejs + expressjs```, vscode stands out. Espiecially for code completion but I could be wrong since I've never bothered to set up ```ternjs``` for my vim. 

Enough with the blabbering, I'd still need to get back to work. =D
