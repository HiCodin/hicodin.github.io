As title says it all, `Laziness` has been the most destructing thing that has been plauging me as far as I can remember. I'd just stare at the ceiling for hours without doing much, watch at youtube videos for hours long while deadlines are the next morning. I could go on and on about How lazy I am but I'll just stop here.

In fact, I am writing this post because I am lazy to read my studies ! :(

I'll just stop now. I should get back to reading OOP books and stop being lazy.
