Hello, My name is HiCodin.

# What do you do?
I am still learning to become a full-stack developer. I have a [Github](https://github.com/hicodin) account but nothing much is on it except for my vim and emacs configs.

# What programming languages do you use?
I use ```PHP```, ```Nodejs``` as of right now but learning ```Ruby``` to improve my programming skills. I love ```Python``` too.
